## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- [FontStyles](https://fonts.googleapis.com) - For styles
- [Media Logo](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css) - For social media logo

### What I learned

- I was able to use CSS Flexbox to achieve this project
- I was able to learn responsiveness using media query
- Further understanding on font styling
- Further understanding on how to insert and style social media icon and logo

### Continued development

- need more clearification on bacground images styling using css
- more works need to be done on media query and responsiveness
- further study on social media icons and logo styling

### Useful resources

- [w3school site](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_social_media_buttons.asp) - This helped me understand how to style social media logo and icon.
- [RWD media query](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand RWD media query. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
